## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   scss

### What I learned

setting up a light mode and darkmode looked to be a bit complicated using scss so I decided to use css custom properties to toggle the colors for the different modes.

I learned about inline SVGs and accessibility with the <title> and <description> tags
